Ehsan is part of my legal identification string.

Automation, DevOps, Games, and the magical lines commanding lightning-powered sandstone thingamajigs pique my interest.

Shell be my language on many a night - as in learning as an aside to my University material.

The lack of comfort in an environment pains me - so I fiddle with languages and tools, like Docker and C. I won't be producing partial projects persisting at most a month with them for now, but I aim to do so eventually - maybe some will make me proud.  

Linux makes me cherish my system between the midnight-to-morning troubleshooting sessions. It's less of a black box after all - notwithstanding my remnant mystique over the flowing depths of the kernel.

also, ML is very cool. wow.
